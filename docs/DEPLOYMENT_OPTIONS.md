## 📋 **Free Tier Deployment Steps**

### 1. Prerequisites
```powershell
# Check if you have everything
terraform version  # Should show v1.13.1
aws --version       # Should show v2.25.7
docker --version    # Any recent version
```

### 2. AWS Account Setup
1. Create AWS account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. Set up billing (credit card required, but won't be charged)
3. Create IAM user with AdministratorAccess
4. Download credentials CSV

### 3. Configure AWS CLI
```powershell
aws configure
# Enter your Access Key ID, Secret Key, region (us-east-1), format (json)
```

### 4. Deploy!
```powershell
# One command deployment!
.\scripts\deploy-free-tier.ps1

# Follow the prompts - takes about 10-15 minutes
```

### 5. Access Your API
After deployment:
- **API**: `http://YOUR_ELASTIC_IP/health`
- **Docs**: `http://YOUR_ELASTIC_IP/docs`
- **Admin**: `http://YOUR_ELASTIC_IP/redoc`

## 🔧 **What Gets Created (Free Tier)**

### AWS Resources:
- **1x EC2 t3.micro instance** (always free for 12 months)
- **1x RDS db.t3.micro** (always free for 12 months)
- **1x Elastic IP** (free when attached)
- **VPC + Subnets + Security Groups** (always free)
- **ECR Repository** (500MB free)
- **IAM Roles** (always free)

### Application Setup:
- **Docker container** running your BRS backend
- **PostgreSQL database** with your data
- **Automatic health checks**
- **Log monitoring**
- **Easy SSH access** for management

---

## 🚀 **Migration Path**

Start with **Free Tier** and upgrade later:

1. **Deploy Free Tier** - Learn the system ($0/month)
2. **Add Domain & SSL** - Professional setup (+$12/year for domain)
3. **Scale to Production** - When you need more users (~$175/month)

The migration is straightforward - your data and application remain the same!

---

## 🆘 **Support & Troubleshooting**

### Free Tier Common Issues:
1. **Instance not responding**: Wait 2-3 minutes for Docker to start
2. **Can't connect**: Check security groups allow port 80
3. **Health check fails**: SSH in and check logs: `docker logs brs-backend`

### Commands for Debugging:
```powershell
# SSH into your instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/brs-key ec2-user@YOUR_IP

# Check application status
docker ps
docker logs brs-backend

# Restart application
cd /opt/brs-backend && ./deploy.sh
```

## 🎉 **Ready to Start?**

**For Free Tier deployment**, just run:
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-free-tier.ps1
```

**For Production deployment**, run:
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-aws-windows.ps1 -DomainName "api.yourdomain.com"
```

Both scripts handle everything automatically - from infrastructure setup to application deployment!

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Start Free**: Always start with free tier to learn the system
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check AWS billing dashboard to stay within free limits
3. **Backup Data**: Export your data before experimenting
4. **Set Billing Alerts**: Get notified if you exceed free tier
5. **Keep Learning**: The skills transfer directly to production deployment

**Your BRS backend will be running on AWS in under 15 minutes!** 🚀
